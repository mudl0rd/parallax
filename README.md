**General use by anyone is not recommended. At all. Use other libretro cores and N64 emulators.**

## What?

Personal N64 emulator code playset for anything with:

* **x86 CPUs w/SSE4.2+ 4 threads and above**.
* **ARM+NEON supporting CPUs around RPI4 level and above**.
* **Win7 and above**/modern Linux
* **Modern GCC/G++ with C++17 support**

## How?

Making a massive garbage fire by modding mupen64plus-next/parallel-n64.

Lets see where it goes from here...
