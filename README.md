**Use other libretro cores and N64 emulators for any use for gaming.** 

**Please**

## What?

Personal N64 emulator code playset for anything with:

* **x86 CPUs w/SSE4.1 OR RPI4 level hardware**.
* **Vulkan 1.1 or OGL 4.6/ES3**.
* **Win7 and above/modern Linux**
* **Modern GCC/G++ with C++17 and up support**

## How?

Making a garbage fire by hacking on parallel-n64 to see what the heck happens, if any.

This is in no way intended to be a "daily driver" or even maintained as such. This is worked on **entirely** when I feel like to mess around with N64 things.
